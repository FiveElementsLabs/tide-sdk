# Tide Protocol SDK

> Tide SDK is a free and open source software (FOSS) development platform for interacting with the Tide Protocol API.

## Development

To get started, follow these instructions:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tide-sdk

# Change directory
cd tide-sdk/sdk

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the SDK
yarn build
```

Now that you have built the SDK locally, you can see it in action in the `testing` directory by running:

```shell
# Change directory to the testing directory
cd ../testing

# Install dependencies (this will also pull from the `sdk` directory)
yarn install

# Run the Nextjs development server
yarn dev
```

At this point, you should be able to see the testing app running at `http://localhost:3000`.
