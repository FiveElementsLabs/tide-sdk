# Tide-SDK Example App

> This is a simple example NextJS frontend app using the Tide Protocol SDK.

This minimal example is meant to show how you might integrate the Tide SDK in your existing project
using NextJS. You are free to use the same principles and apply them to any other framework or
javascript web technology of your choice.

## Getting Started

This example uses the SDK from a local build in the `sdk` directory.

To get started with the example, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `sdk` directory, and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
2. Build the SDK locally by running `yarn build`.
3. Now navigate to the `example` directory, and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the example app.
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to see the example app in action.

You can run all these instructions in one go by pasting this into your terminal
from the root of this repository:

```shell
cd sdk && yarn install && yarn build && cd ../example && yarn install && yarn dev
```
