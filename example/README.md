# Tide-SDK Example App

> This is a simple example NextJS frontend app using the Tide Protocol SDK.

This minimal example is meant to show how you might integrate the Tide SDK in your existing project
using NextJS. You are free to use the same principles and apply them to any other framework or
javascript web technology of your choice.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SDK, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the SDK on your site using your preferred package manager (`npm install tide-sdk`)
2. Create a new referral campaign on [tideprotocol.xyz](https://tideprotocol.xyz)
3. Copy the campaign "Referral API Token" from the campaign settings page
4. Initialize the SDK in your app using the provided token
5. Track referrals and other events in real-time
